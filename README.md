# 🚀 fastapi_react_ai

A full-stack AI-powered web app built with FastAPI and React.  
This project is part of my personal learning journey to understand how to build, integrate, and deploy modern web applications combining AI, frontend, backend, and authentication systems.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

🛠 **Note**: For detailed setup and explanation, follow the original video tutorial:
[Tech With Tim - Secure AI App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13tMEW8r6C0)

This README intentionally skips deep setup steps, since the video does a clearer job explaining:

- Environment setup (Node.js, Python)
- Clerk configuration
- FastAPI + React integration
- Ngrok tunneling for local auth

## 📈 Project Status

🚧 **In Progress**  
Currently replicating the tutorial, then planning to add extra features beyond the original guide. Already added:

- ✅ Quota system to limit API usage
- 🔄 More features planned once fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and full-stack workflows are solid
